## üìä Calculation Method

The DCF valuation follows these steps:

### 1. EBITDA Calculation
```
EBITDA = Revenue - Operating Expenses
```

### 2. Free Cash Flow (FCF)
```
FCF = EBITDA - Taxes - CapEx - Change in Working Capital
```

### 3. Growth Projections
* Projects cash flows for 5 years
* Uses specified growth rate
* Compounds annually

### 4. Terminal Value
```
Terminal Value = FCF √ó (1 + Growth Rate) / (Discount Rate - Growth Rate)
```

### 5. Final Valuation
* Sum of:
  * Discounted future cash flows
  * Discounted terminal value
